        I'm a tenured software engineer passionate about solving challenging,
        real-world problems with new, innovative tech. I have 8+ years of
        experience as a SWE, and currently work as a Staff Engineer at Onaroll.
        I've worked across the entire stack, architected both frontend
        applications and servers/microservices from day 0.

        in fintech, health tech and workforce tech.
